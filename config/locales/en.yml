      preamble: These are the requirements for scripts posted to %{site_name}. These are intended to keep %{site_name} a safe and useful place for user scripts. Any script falling outside these requirements may be deleted by %{site_name} moderators.
      functionality_header: Functionality
      description: Scripts must include a description of what they do and may not do things unreasonably outside of this description. Users must know what a script will do before installing it.
      reason: Scripts must have a reason to be a script. For example, a script that just directs a user to a website doesn't need to be a script; it could be a link. Scripts that use a web service to perform an action on the current page (e.g. to convert it in some way) are allowed.
      monetization_html: Scripts that contain features for the benefit of the <em>author</em> rather than the user (such as tracking, ads, and miners) are allowed, but these must be disclosed with %{antifeature_link:<code>@antifeature</code> meta keys}.
      code_header: Code
      obfuscation: Code posted to %{site_name} must not be obfuscated or minified. Users must be given the opportunity to inspect and understand a script before installing it. If the script is bundled by a tool such as webpack, it must be output in non-minified form.
      libraries_html: Libraries that a script uses should be <code>@require</code>-d, unless there's a valid technical reason not to do so. In the case that a library is included inline, it must include information as to the source of the library (e.g. a comment indicating URL and/or name and version).
      updates: Scripts must not check for updates at a rate higher than once per day. Note that most user script managers will handle automatic updates, so doing it in the script is unnecessary. Scripts should also not dynamically inject another %{site_name}-hosted script into a page, as this bypasses caching in user script managers.
      external_js: "%{external_scripts_link:Use of external JavaScript is limited.}"
      copyright_header: Copyright
      licensing_html: Your script must respect others' copyrights. This includes the code itself and any resources (for example images) it uses. If you intend on using someone else's content, abide by their licensing terms or get their permission before doing so. Licenses on scripts are specified by the <code>@license</code> meta key, and you can learn about what you can and cannot do by using %{tldr_legal_link:tldrlegal.com}.
      reposts: Even in cases not violating the copyright rule, reposts of scripts that are already on %{site_name} are not allowed unless they are improving upon the original.
      miscellaneous_header: Miscellaneous
      keywords_html: Scripts must not include <code>@include</code>s, <code>@match</code>es, or keywords for sites they do not provide functionality on.
      adult_content_rule: Scripts that include adult content or are for sites with adult content must be marked as such to allow other users the option of whether to see them.
      reporting: If you notice a script that falls outside of these parameters, please report it by going to the Feedback link for that script and choosing the "Report script" option.

      content_html: >
        <p>User scripts have the technical ability to load and execute other scripts. The %{require_doc_link:<code>@require</code>} metadata key is the most straightforward way to accomplish this, but scripts can also, for example, use an XmlHttpRequest to download a script and then inject it into the DOM.</p>
        <p>While this is a useful feature and most script authors use this for legitimate purposes, it can also be used maliciously. One of the core principles of %{site_name} is that the user must be able to inspect the code in a script. External scripts can bypass this principle in a number of ways: they can change without warning or history, they can serve up different code to different people, and they can be used to hide malicious code in the middle of known libraries. Even if someone were to check an external script and determine it to be legitimate, that would be no guarantee that that script always has been or always will be legitimate.</p>
        <p>To allow script authors to continue to use external scripts, %{site_name} has implemented a list of allowed URL patterns that can be included with a script. This list consists of script locations that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are public</li>
          <li>Will not have their contents change frequently</li>
          <li>Would likely be useful to more than one script author</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current list is:</p>
        %{allowed_require_list}
        <p>If you try to post a script that uses a <code>@require</code> outside of these locations, you will not be able to save your script.</p>
        <p>If the script you wish to include is a JavaScript library (for example jQuery or YUI), try to find it on one of the sites listed above. %{cdnjs_link:cdnjs} and %{jsdelivr_link:jsDelivr} in particular have a wide range of libraries available.</p>
        <p>If the script you wish to include is not available on the sites above, %{contact_link:let us know} and we can find somewhere it is (or host it ourselves!).</p>
        <p>If the script you wish to include was written by you, you can submit it as a separate entry on %{site_name} by choosing the "Library" script type. You will then be able to include this posted library in your script.</p>

          <li><code>@updateURL</code>, <code>@installURL</code>, and <code>@downloadURL</code> directives will be stripped, if present. The lack of these directives means that any script installed from %{site_name} will be updated from %{site_name}.</li>
          <li><code>@version</code> and <code>@namespace</code> directives will be inserted if the script is missing them. These directives are needed for proper updating.</li>

        <p>There are a number of ways to talk about %{site_name} and the things on it.</p>
        <p>Do you have a question or comment about a specific script posted on the site? If so, post a discussion from the link on the Feedback tab on that script's page. Script authors get notification on their account page of any discussions on their scripts.</p>
        <p>Do you have a question or comment on %{site_name} itself or on script development, or do you want someone to make you a script? %{forum_link:Posting in the forum} would give you the widest audience for your discussion.</p>
        <p>Do you have a bug report or fully-formed idea for %{site_name} itself (and not a specific script <em>posted on</em> %{site_name})? %{github_link:Post it on the GitHub page.}</p>
        <p>Do you have a private question or comment you would like only the admin to see? %{admin_email_link:Send an e-mail.}</p>

        <p>This page describes how %{site_name} will record or track users. If you have any concerns, %{admin_email_link:e-mail the admin}.</p>
        <h2>Server logs</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} logs all requests in a typical server log fashion. Information logged includes pages visited, IP address, and user agent string. These logs are for debugging and server analysis. The data is retained for one week. This data is not shared or made publicly available.</p>
        <h2>Script statistics</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of generating statistics, %{site_name} records install and update requests with IP address information. This information is retained for one day, and then is aggregated to no longer include the IP address. The IP-address-specific data is not shared or made publicly available, but the aggregated data is.</p>
        <h2>Cookies (when not logged in)</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} may set temporary session cookies to allow for some site features. These cookies are not set to persist and may cleared when the browser is closed (depending on browser settings).</p>
        <h2>User accounts</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} requires users to create an account to post scripts, take part in discussions, and access some other site features. When creating an account, information such as IP address, e-mail address, and user agent may be permanently stored. Some of this information may be made visible to other users.</p>
        <p>Actions performed when logged in, for example posting scripts and comments, will be made viewable to other users.</p>
        <p>If the "Remember me" option is checked when logging in to an account, %{site_name} will set a persistent cookie to retain login state.</p>
        <h2>Scripts posted on %{site_name}</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} contains user-generated content, and scripts posted may be able to track users if they install that script.</p>
        <h2>Third party libraries</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} may include third party code to collect statistics or display advertisements on the site. These libraries may include tracking logic.</p>

    antifeatures:
      title: Antifeatures
      intro_html: |
        <p>Antifeatures are things added to scripts to benefit the authors rather than users, such as ads or tracking. Scripts with antifeatures are allowed according to %{rules_link:%{site_name}'s rules} but they must be marked with <code>@antifeature</code> in the script's metadata block. Doing so will ensure the user is aware of the antifeature prior to installing.</p>
        <p>Antifeatures are specified as %{meta_keys_link:script meta keys} with the format <code>@antifeature <i>type</i> <i>description</i></code>. <i>type</i> is required and <i>description</i> is optional.</p>
        <p>This page describes the types of <code>@antifeature</code> recognized by %{site_name}. Other types may be used, but the presence of the antifeature must not be against %{rules_link:%{site_name}'s rules}.</p>
      ads_html: |
        <p>The script inserts advertisements on pages the user visits.</p>
        <p>The following do <i>not</i> require the use of <code>@antifeature ads</code>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A script that affects a website that contains ads.</li>
          <li>A script links or otherwise directs the user to a website that contains ads, as long as that website provides some functionality when integrated with the script.</li>
          <li>Promotion of the script author's homepage, code repository, Discord, WeChat, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      membership_html: |
        <p>The script requires the user to subscribe to a channel, join a group, like a page, etc. for the script to be fully functional.</p>

        <p>The following do <i>not</i> require the use of <code>@antifeature membership</code>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A script that affects the logged-in area of a website, but the script itself does not require additional logging in.</li>
          <li>A script where support is provided via a platform that requires membership, as long as such support is not required for the user to have full functionality.</li>
          <li>Links to the author's channel, group, page, etc. that do not affect the script's functionality.</li>
        </ul>
      miner_html: |
        <p>The script contains a cryptominer or other code that uses the user's resources to perform some task for the script author.</p>
      payment_html: |
        <p>The script requires the user pay the script author for the script to be fully functional.</p>

        <p>The following do <i>not</i> require the use of <code>@antifeature payment</code>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A script that affects a website that requires payment, but the script itself does not require payment.</li>
          <li>A script that asks for donations, as long as the donation does not unlock additional functionality.</li>
        </ul>
      referral_link_html: |
        <p>The script performs some action that earns the author commission on purchases. This includes the script containing referral/affiliate links, rewriting existing links to be referral/affiliate links, or providing coupon codes that earn the script author commission.</p>
      tracking_html: |
        <p>The script includes code to track user activity. This includes trackers such as Google Analytics or custom tracking code that reports user activity to the script author.</p>

          Your script '%{script_name}' on %{site_name} (%{script_url}) has received multiple "Bad" reviews in a row.

          The feedback you've received at %{feedback_url} may indicate a problem with your script, a temporary outage, or a change to the underlying site. Please review the feedback, fix any issues, and reply to the concerns raised.

          %{site_name} strives to maintain a high-quality list of scripts for users. To deal with broken, abandoned scripts, those that receive multiple consecutive "Bad" reviews without a timely response will become hidden. To avoid your script becoming hidden, post a new version or reply to the discussions by %{delete_date}. If you take no action, you will still have the option to make it visible again after this date.

      # content of the page. The link to greasespot can be updated to a better resource if one is available in your language. code_rules_link and meta_keys_link are links to those help pages, with text of those page's titles. ask_in_forum_link is a link to the forum with text of ask_in_forum_link_text. user_page_link is a link to the user's page if the user is signed in, or plain text if they're not; in either case, the text is user_page_link_text. post_new_script_link is a link to the new script page, with text of post_new_script_link_text
      content_html: "<p>Writing user scripts requires knowledge of JavaScript. The <a href=\"http://wiki.greasespot.net/Tutorials\">tutorials on the GreaseSpot Wiki</a> should give you a running start on JavaScript both in general and as it relates to user scripts. Inspecting others' scripts can be helpful. You may be interested in %{code_rules_link} and %{meta_keys_link}. If you want help developing your script, feel free to %{ask_in_forum_link}.</p><p>To post on %{site_name}, you will need to create an account. From your %{user_page_link}, follow the link to %{post_new_script_link}.</p>"

        <p>These are the requirements for scripts posted to %{site_name}. These are intended to keep %{site_name} a safe and useful place for user scripts. Any script falling outside these requirements may be deleted by %{site_name} moderators.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scripts must include a description of what they do and may not do things unreasonably outside of this description. Users must know what a script will do before installing it.</li>
          <li>Code posted to this site must not be obfuscated or minified. Users must be given the opportunity to inspect and understand a script before installing it.</li>
          <li>Libraries that a script uses should be <code>@require</code>-d, unless there's a valid technical reason not to do so. In the case that a library is included inline, it must include information as to the source of the library (e.g. a comment indicating URL and/or name and version).</li>
          <li>Your script must respect others' copyrights. This includes the script itself and any resources (for example images) it uses. If you intend on using someone else's content, abide by their licensing terms or get their permission before doing so.</li>
          <li>%{external_scripts_link:Use of external JavaScript is limited.}</li>
          %{adult_content_requirement}
        </ul>
        <p>If you notice a script that falls outside of these parameters, please report it by going to the Feedback link for that script, starting a discussion, and choosing the "Report script" option.</p>
        <p>If you disagree with any of this, %{contact_link:let's talk about it}!</p>
      # optional part of the rules page content for sites that disallow adult content
      adult_content_rule_html: "<li>Scripts that include adult content or are for sites with adult content must be marked as such to allow other users the option of whether to see them.</li>"

        <p>User scripts have the technical ability to load and execute other scripts. The %{require_doc_link:<code>@require</code>} metadata key is the most straightforward way to accomplish this, but scripts can also, for example, use an XmlHttpRequest to download a script and then inject it into the DOM.</p>
        <p>While this is a useful feature and most script authors use this for legitimate purposes, it can also be used maliciously. One of the core principles of %{site_name} is that the user must be able to inspect the code in a script. External scripts can bypass this principle in a number of ways: they can change without warning or history, they can serve up different code to different people, and they can be used to hide malicious code in the middle of known libraries. Even if someone were to check an external script and determine it to be legitimate, that would be no guarantee that that script always has been or always will be legitimate.</p>
        <p>To allow script authors to continue to use external scripts, %{site_name} has implemented a whitelist of URL patterns that can be included with a script. This whitelist consists of script locations that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are public</li>
          <li>Will not have their contents change frequently</li>
          <li>Would likely be useful to more than one script author</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current list is:</p>
        %{allowed_require_list}
        <p>If you try to post a script that uses a <code>@require</code> outside of these locations, you will not be able to save your script.</p>
        <p>If the script you wish to include is a JavaScript library (for example jQuery or YUI), try to find it on one of the sites listed above. %{cdnjs_link:cdnjs} and %{jsdelivr_link:jsDelivr} in particular have a wide range of libraries available.</p>
        <p>If the script you wish to include is not available on the sites above, %{contact_link:let us know} and we can find somewhere it is (or host it ourselves!).</p>
        <p>If the script you wish to include was written by you, you can submit it as a separate entry on %{site_name} by choosing the "Library" script type. You will then be able to include this posted library in your script.</p>

      # content of the rewriting page
      content_html: >
        <p>Scripts posted to %{site_name} will be rewritten in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>@updateURL</code>, <code>@installURL</code>, and <code>@downloadURL</code> directives will be stripped, if present. The lack of these directives means that any script installed from %{site_name} will be updated from %{site_name}.</li>
          <li><code>@version</code> and <code>@namespace</code> directives will be inserted if the script is missing them. These directives are needed for proper updating.</li>
          <li><code>@description</code> will be inserted if a new version of a script is missing it and a previous version of the script had it.</li>
          <li>CRLF and CR line breaks will be converted to standard/Unix-style line breaks.</li>

        <h2>Server logs</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} logs all requests in a typical server log fashion. Information logged includes pages visited, IP address, and user agent string. These logs are for debugging and server analysis. The data is retained for one week. This data is not shared or made publicly available.</p>
        <h2>Script statistics</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of generating statistics, %{site_name} records install and update requests with IP address information. This information is retained for one day, and then is aggregated to no longer include the IP address. The IP-address-specific data is not shared or made publicly available, but the aggregated data is.</p>
        <h2>Cookies (when not logged in)</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} may set temporary session cookies to allow for some site features. These cookies are not set to persist and may cleared when the browser is closed (depending on browser settings).</p>
        <h2>User accounts</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} requires users to create an account to post scripts, take part in discussions, and access some other site features. When creating an account, information such as IP address, e-mail address, and user agent may be permanently stored. Some of this information may be made visible to other users.</p>
        <p>Actions performed when logged in, for example posting scripts and comments, will be made viewable to other users.</p>
        <p>If the "Remember me" option is checked when logging in to an account, %{site_name} will set a persistent cookie to retain login state.</p>
        <h2>Scripts posted on %{site_name}</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} contains user-generated content, and scripts posted may be able to track users if they install that script.</p>
        <h2>Third party libraries</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} may include third party code to collect statistics or display advertisements on the site. These libraries may include tracking logic.</p>

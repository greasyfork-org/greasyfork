        <ul>
          <li>The name of a license (for example, <code>@license GPL3</code>). Using a "Full name" or "Identifier" from %{spdx_link:the SPDX License List} is recommended.</li>

      title: "%{site_name}'s rules for posted scripts"
      preamble: These are the requirements for scripts posted to %{site_name}. These are intended to keep %{site_name} a safe and useful place for user scripts. Any script falling outside these requirements may be deleted by %{site_name} moderators.
      functionality_header: Functionality
      description: Scripts must include a description of what they do and may not do things unreasonably outside of this description. Users must know what a script will do before installing it.
      reason: Scripts must have a reason to be a script. For example, a script that just directs a user to a website doesn't need to be a script; it could be a link. Scripts that use a web service to perform an action on the current page (e.g. to convert it in some way) are allowed.
      monetization_html: Scripts that contain features for the benefit of the <em>author</em> rather than the user (such as tracking, ads, and miners) are allowed, but these must be disclosed with %{antifeature_link:<code>@antifeature</code> meta keys}. Scripts must not add <code>@include</code>s or <code>@match</code>es for the sole purpose adding antifeatures.
      code_header: Code
      obfuscation: Code posted to %{site_name} must not be obfuscated or minified. Users must be given the opportunity to inspect and understand a script before installing it. If the script is bundled by a tool such as webpack, it must be output in non-minified form, with whitespace and variable names retained.
      size_html: |
        Scripts are limited to a size of %{max_code_size}. Scripts may not be minified to fit under this limit. If your script is nearing this limit, you may want to consider:
        <ul>
          <li>Moving non-code data such as data URIs or JSON outside of the script.</li>
          <li>Loading libraries using <code>@require</code> or with %{webpack_externals_link:webpack's <code>externals</code> option}.</li>
        </ul>
      libraries_html: Libraries that a script uses should be <code>@require</code>-d, unless there's a valid technical reason not to do so. In the case that a library is included inline, it must include information as to the source of the library (e.g. a comment indicating URL and/or name and version).
      updates: Scripts must not check for updates at a rate higher than once per day. Note that most user script managers will handle automatic updates, so doing it in the script is unnecessary. Scripts should also not dynamically inject another %{site_name}-hosted script into a page, as this bypasses caching in user script managers.
      hosting: The primary functionality of a script must be within the code on %{site_name}. A script posted on %{site_name} that simply loads the bulk of the script from somewhere else is not allowed. Posting of alternate download URLs, with the intent of having users use the alternate sources instead of the version posted to %{site_name}, is not allowed.
      external_js: "%{external_scripts_link:Use of external JavaScript is limited.}"
      copyright_header: Copyright
      licensing_html: Your script must respect others' copyrights. This includes the code itself and any resources (for example images) it uses. If you intend on using someone else's content, abide by their licensing terms or get their permission before doing so. Licenses on scripts are specified by the <code>@license</code> meta key, and you can learn about what you can and cannot do by using %{tldr_legal_link:tldrlegal.com}.
      reposts: Even in cases not violating the copyright rule, reposts of scripts that are already on %{site_name} are not allowed unless they are improving upon the original.
      miscellaneous_header: Miscellaneous
      keywords: Scripts must not include unrelated keywords or mention unrelated sites to attempt to improve search placement.
      adult_content_rule: Scripts that include adult content or are for sites with adult content must be marked as such to allow other users the option of whether to see them.
      reposting_deleted: Do not repost scripts that were deleted due to rule violations; use the appeal function instead. Reposting deleted scripts may result in a ban.
      advertising_in_description: Script authors may not place advertising on pages on Greasy Fork, for example in a script's description. Promotion of the script author's homepage, code repository, Discord, WeChat, etc. is allowed.
      reporting: If you notice a script that falls outside of these parameters, please report it by going to the Feedback link for that script and choosing the "Report script" option.
      excessive_updates: Script authors may not update scripts excessively with the sole purpose of ranking higher on the script list.
      non_functional_includes_html: Scripts may not include <code>@include</code>s or <code>@match</code>es for sites they do not provide functionality on.
      content_language: Scripts' names, descriptions, and other content must be marked with the proper language.
      listing_header: Listing
    external_scripts:
      # title of the external script rules page
      title: "%{site_name}'s policy on external scripts"
      # content of the external script rules page
      intro_html: |
        <p>%{site_name} permits the use of external code in specific cases. Any script found to be including external code outside of what is permitted is subject to be deleted. If you find a script violating these rules, please report it.</p>
        <p>Note that these rules only apply to external, executable code. Loading non-executable code, for example JSON or CSS, is not restricted.</p>
      rationale:
        title: Rationale
        content_html: |
          <p>User scripts have the technical ability to load and execute other scripts. This can be done in a few different ways, including:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>The %{require_doc_link:<code>@require</code>} and %{resource_doc_link:<code>@resource</code>} metadata keys.</li>
          <li><code>XmlHttpRequest</code> to download the script, then <code>eval</code> to execute.</li>
          <li>Adding a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag dynamically.</li>
          <li>Webpack's %{webpack_externals_link:<code>externals</code>} option.</li>
          <li>Performing an update of the script, whether performed automatically or by directing the user to perform an action.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While this is a useful feature and most script authors use this for legitimate purposes, it can also be used maliciously. One of the core principles of %{site_name} is that the user must be able to inspect the code in a script. External scripts can bypass this principle in a number of ways: they can change without warning or history, they can serve up different code to different people, and they can be used to hide malicious code in the middle of known libraries. Even if someone were to check an external script and determine it to be legitimate, that would be no guarantee that that script always has been or always will be legitimate.</p>
      cdns:
        title: Content delivery networks (CDNs)
        content_html: |
          <p>Code from CDNs is allowed. %{cdns_link:See a list of recognized CDNs.} This code may be minified, but not obfuscated.</p>
      sri:
        title: Scripts with subresource integrity hashes
        content_html: |
          <p>Use of <code>@require</code> and <code>@resource</code> with URLs with %{mdn_sri_link:subresource integrity} in the %{tm_sri_link:Tampermonkey format} is allowed.</p>
      allowed_external_codes:
        heading: Allowed external codes
        content_html: |
          <p>The following are the ways external code is allowed on %{site_name}. Unless otherwise specified, all other %{code_rules_link:rules for code} apply to the external code.</p>
      libraries:
        title: "%{site_name} libraries"
        content_html: |
          <p>Scripts posted as libraries on %{site_name} are allowed. Libraries can be created by choosing the option when creating a new script. These can additionally be set to sync from an external URL, like a GitHub repository.</p>
      origin_host:
        title: Injection of scripts from the origin host
        content_html: |
          <p>Injection of external scripts on the same domain as where they came from is allowed. If a script runs on https://example.com, and downloads https://example.com/script.js, modifies it, and injects back on https://example.com/, this would be allowed.</p>
          <p>If https://example.com/script.js is injected onto https://differentsite.com, this would be disallowed.</p>
    cdns:
      title: Allowed CDNs
      content_html: |
        <p>This is a list of CDNs recognized by %{site_name}. These may be used to load %{external_code_link:external code} on scripts posted on %{site_name}.</p>
        <p>This list consists of script locations that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are public</li>
          <li>Will not have their contents change frequently</li>
          <li>Would likely be useful to more than one script author</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the script you wish to include is a JavaScript library (for example jQuery or YUI), try to find it on one of the sites listed below. %{cdnjs_link:cdnjs} and %{jsdelivr_link:jsDelivr} in particular have a wide range of libraries available. If you have a CDN you would like to be added, please %{github_link:request it on GitHub}. Note that there are %{external_code_link:other options} for external code other than CDNs.</p>

        <h2>Server logs</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} logs all requests in a typical server log fashion. Information logged includes pages visited, IP address, and user agent string. These logs are for debugging and server analysis. The data is retained for one week. This data is not shared or made publicly available.</p>
        <h2>Script statistics</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of generating statistics, %{site_name} records install and update requests with IP address information. This information is retained for one day, and then is aggregated to no longer include the IP address. The IP-address-specific data is not shared or made publicly available, but the aggregated data is.</p>
        <h2>Cookies (when not logged in)</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} may set temporary session cookies to allow for some site features. These cookies are not set to persist and may cleared when the browser is closed (depending on browser settings).</p>
        <h2>User accounts</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} requires users to create an account to post scripts, take part in discussions, and access some other site features. When creating an account, information such as IP address, e-mail address, and user agent may be permanently stored. Some of this information may be made visible to other users.</p>
        <p>Actions performed when logged in, for example posting scripts and comments, will be made viewable to other users.</p>
        <p>If the "Remember me" option is checked when logging in to an account, %{site_name} will set a persistent cookie to retain login state.</p>
        <h2>Scripts posted on %{site_name}</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} contains user-generated content, and scripts posted may be able to track users if they install that script.</p>
        <h2>Third party libraries</h2>
        <p>%{site_name} may include third party code to collect statistics or display advertisements on the site. These libraries may include tracking logic.</p>
    user_css_to_user_js:
      title: Conversion of user CSS to user JS
      content_html: |
        <p>%{site_name} can convert user CSS to user JS format. <code>@-moz-document</code> rules are converted into JavaScript <code>if</code> statements, building the CSS to apply. This CSS is appended to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element.</p>

        <p>The presence of some user CSS features precludes conversion to user JS format. When these features are detected, user JS conversion will not be done.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><code>@preprocessor</code> meta keys other than <code>default</code></li>
        <li><code>@var</code> meta keys</li>
        </ul>

        <p>%{site_name}'s user JS may load the CSS somewhat differently than user CSS does.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>In user JS, the CSS inserted as the last element of <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. In user CSS, this may depend on the extension used. It's recommended to use <code>!important</code> to mitigate this issue.</li>
        <li>In user JS, the CSS will be calculated and applied once on page load. The page's use of the JavaScript history API may result in the CSS not being applied as expected.</li>
        <li>User JS may not apply the CSS to frames or iframes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you find the user JS conversion doesn't work, you should choose the option to make it unavailable when you update your user CSS.</p>

Scripts with antifeatures are allowed according to %{rules_link:%{site_name}'s rules} but they must be marked with <code>@antifeature</code> in the script's metadata block. Doing so will ensure the user is aware of the antifeature prior to installing.</p>
        <p>Antifeatures are specified as %{meta_keys_link:script meta keys} with the format <code>@antifeature <i>type</i> <i>description</i></code>. <i>type</i> is required and <i>description</i> is optional.</p>

      <p>For scripts from source control, ensure that the URL you use refers to a branch and not a specific commit, otherwise it will never get updated.
